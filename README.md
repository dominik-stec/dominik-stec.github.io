            <p style="text-indent: 4%">This document contain all phases of construct my own idea for realise engineering project for Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology. <br/> I constructed embedded system with hardware prototype for motorcycles drivers. <br /> This project base on Android mobile application connected with Raspberry Pi IoT board which maintain laser distance measuring sensor. <br /> On the smartphone screen we can observe real-time graphics simulation of vehicle ride. On screen during drive the motorcycle we can see actual distace between motorcycle and following car and actual speed of ride. When speed is to high according to keep distance between vehicles the system inform us on the screen that it is impossible to suddenly stop the car with avoid the crash and suggest us safe speed of ride in actual traffic configuration.</p>
